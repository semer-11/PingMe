# Ping Me Bot Documentation

Ping Me bot is a Telegram Bot which I developed to help me keep track of Telegram notifications regarding my school stuffs. You can modify it the way you would like to use.
* By setting the "SOURCES" environment variable, you can specify from which sources you'd like to receive messages.
* These sources are defined by comma-separated chat_ids from Telegram chats.

## Usage

1. **Gemini API Key**: 
   - This bot utilizes Gemini Google's language model, thus you need to have a Gemini API key.

2. **Telegraph Package Dependency**
   - This bot uses the [Telegraph package](https://defstudio.github.io/telegraph/), so it's essential to read the documentation on how to set up and run your bot accordingly.

3. **Set Sources**: 
   - Define the "SOURCES" environment variable with the desired chat_ids of the sources from Telegram chats. Separate multiple chat_ids with commas. 
  - **Note**: This is not required,it's up to you.
